  <p>
    Merengue is a type of music and dance originating in the Dominican Republic
    which has become a very popular genre throughout Latin America, and also in
    several major cities in the United States which have Hispanic communities.

  In more urban settings, merengue is played with all manner of instrumentation,
  but the tambora and the güira are signatures. Today, merengue de orquesta is
  most popular. It uses a large horn section with paired saxophones, piano,
  timbales, hi-hat, backup singers, and conga, in addition to tambora, güira,
  and bass. In modern merengue típico a saxophone is an addition to the accordion,
  along with electric bass guitar. A proof of the great adaptability of the music
  can be found in the Dominican National Symphony's presentation in 2003 of a
  concert series entitled "Symphonic Merengue", in which the Symphonic Orchestra
  consisting of woodwinds, brass, strings, and the like played popular tunes.
